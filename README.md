# Juno 60 Chorus Emulation for Korg *louges

**Time** knob controls mode: I - II - I and II.

**Depth** knob controls dry/wet ratio.

_Note that the I and II mode is different from the Juno 60 "both buttons in" mode. In this emulation I and II mode enables both choruses in parallel, similar to the TAL U-NO-LX._
