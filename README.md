# Juno 60 Chorus Emulation for Korg *louges

**Time** knob switches between the three modes: I - I+II - II

**Depth** knob controls dry/wet ratio.

_Note that the I+II mode is different from the Juno 60 "both buttons in" mode. In this emulation I+II mode enables both choruses in parallel, similar to the TAL U-NO-LX._
